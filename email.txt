Dear Mr Receiver.

My name is Kiarie Amos, I am a software novice from Earth.

I am writing to inform you of the significant progress we have made here on Terra in and around AI and machine learning.
The team at Open AI has been hard at work for the past 3 years commercializing large language models.
The technology is an Innovation by a research team at google and its ins and outs are described briefly in paper titled "Attention is all you need".

Looking forward to hearing from you.
